    <p class="body">Bill Gates is one of the co-founders of Microsoft, a little company you may or may not have heard of. Its not like the company has a net worth of over 1 trillion dollars or anything. Joking aside, it is one of the largest companies in the world, and is likely responsible for the operating system your laptop or pc uses, called Windows.

    Bill Gates was born in 1955 in Seattle, Washington. At age 13 he had already written his first computer program, which is considerably harder than what I am having to do for this webpage, as instead of being able to get away with semi broken code and having a very flawed super linter that is supposed to help you but only causes more headaches, Gates had very primitive technology. In late 1976, Gates would co-found Microsoft with his friend and buisiness partner Paul Allen. 9 years later, Microsoft released the first version of Windows, known simply as Microsoft Windows. He stepped down from working at Microsoft in 2008, but is still making billions from the company to this day.</p>
